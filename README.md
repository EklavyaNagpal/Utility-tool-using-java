Java, Utility Tool utilizes various features of Java for creating a tool containing a Smart Text Editor and a graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game. There are two different source codes in this minor project in Java: one for the Smart Text Editor and other for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
A smart text editor, a GUI application, is a type of program used to edit plain text files. Smart Text Editor can be used to configure files and programming language source code. A GUI based application even lets a user enter, change, store, print text in different formats and finally create a document. The Smart Text Editor also helps in predicting the spelling errors and tells the predictions for the incorrect word which is even marked with a word count. Tic-Tac-Toe game, with graphical functionality, is supposed to consists of two parts, one a single player game and the other a multi-player game. Tic-Tac-Toe is a game which consists of two players. One of the player chooses the cell of game and put an X mark in the chosen cell while the second player chooses another cell and put an O mark in the second cell. Here multi-player is played with a different user whereas single player is a rule base expert system which plays the game with the user.
